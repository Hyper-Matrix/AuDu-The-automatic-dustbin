# AuDu-The-automatic-dustbin
This is a automatic dustbin, which works using arduino and the phone's inbuilt gyroscope. This dustbin also contains a lid which can be automatically opened or closed when waste materials and brought near it.



Project- contains Remote XY library
AuDu2.ino- contains AuDu's program along with remote xy library,
the project.ino file is just for reference.

Procedure- 
1.Make connections as per circuit diagram images.
2.Upload the following arduino files and do remember to edit the pin nos as per
your requirements.
3.Download REMOTE XY from play store and connect to bluetooth module.


Modifications to Existing Project: 
Earlier the Motion of the dustbin used to be only in four directions.
But the project implements a gyro-based motion of dustbin , thus helping in a multi direction as well as speed-controlled movement.
